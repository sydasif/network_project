### 1. **Device Inventory Details**

  ```yaml
  r1:
    hostname: 192.168.158.223
    platform: ios
    username: admin
    password: cisco
   sw1:
    hostname: 192.168.158.220
    platform: ios
    username: admin
    password: cisco
  ```

### 2. **Decide Inventory Source**

  * Static YAML files (easiest to start)

### 3. **Task(s) to Run**

* Commands I'd like to test first via Nornir:

  * Example:

    * `show ip interface brief`
    * Save running config (`copy run start`)

---

### 4. **Log Output Preferences**

* results should  go?

  * console print and save to Django model (`TaskLog`)?
---

### 5. **GitHub Repo Access**

* just work locally and push later

---

## ⚙️ Tools Setup Confirmation

* Poetry is working (`poetry shell`)
* Django is initialized
* can run: `python manage.py runserver`

---

help me generate:

* Django models
* Inventory logic for Nornir
* A sample task file
* Logging function (DB or file)
